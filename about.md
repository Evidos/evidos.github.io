[Signhost.com](https://www.signhost.com) is a service that makes it possible to digitally sign, seal or deliver your documents. Documents can be signed directly from your webportal or by sending a signing request by email or other message to the end-user.

In some countries Signhost is branded by a locale domain, like ondertekenen.nl in The Netherlands. In this document the signhost.com domain is replaceable by the local promoted domains like [ondertekenen.nl](https://ondertekenen.nl/).

During the signing process of the end-user, different identity verification methods can be used to include in the digital signature ie; email, SMS, scribble signature or authentication mechanisms like Google, LinkedIn, and national eID like DigiD(NL) or eHerkenning(NL).

The service is available via our GUI based online portal: [https://portal.signhost.com/](https://portal.signhost.com/) or via several gateways to connect directly from a third party system.

This document describes the Signhost REST API implementation.

The REST API is the underlying interface for all of our official Signhost API methods. It's the most direct way to access the API.
This reference document is designed for those interested in developing for solutions using the SignHost.com REST Api Signing feature or for those interested in exploring Ondertekenen.nl integration features in detail.

Further details about the methods can be found [here](/).
