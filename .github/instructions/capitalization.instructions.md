# Capitalization

### Headlines

For collateral, press releases, presentation titles, webinar titles, and chart headers, use title case. Initial cap any hyphenated word that would otherwise be initial capped if it were not hyphenated. (e.g. Best-in-Class Printers with Cloud-Based Security)

Capitalize words with four or more letters. Don’t capitalize:

- Articles (a, an, the)
- Coordinating conjunctions (and, but, for)
- Short prepositions (less than 5 letters – e.g., at, by, from)

For email and web page headlines, use sentence case (but capitalize webinar titles, product names, etc.). For banner ads, use all-caps.

### Subhead

Use sentence case, and don’t include a period unless it is more than one thought.
Example: Customers from a wide range of markets deploy Entrust solutions

### Short Section Bullets

Title case/bold bullet section phrases and leave off periods. Use sentence case for supporting content. Use a colon to separate the two.

Examples:

- **Instant Issuance:** Win new customers, drive new revenue, and more
- **High-Volume Card Issuance:** End-to-end solutions for card personalization and delivery

### Standalone Bullets – Sentence Case and Leave Off Periods

Example:
Entrust Identity:

- Complements your existing IT infrastructures and workflows vs. seeking to replace
- Delivers the widest support of VPN, cloud, and on-premises based applications
- Offers a mobile platform with one modern unified app that works across the portfolio

### Capitalization in Product, Service, and Event Names

Do not capitalize Entrust capabilities or generic offering descriptions. Only unique product or service names should be capitalized. Capitalize names of events such as webinars.

### Capitalization in Job Titles and Departments

- Capitalize title when used directly with a person’s name
- Capitalize corporate departments (e.g. She is in charge of the Human Resources department)

### Capitalization after colons

In text, capitalize the first word after a colon only if it is a proper noun or the start of a complete sentence.
