# Punctuation and Formatting

:::tip Important
These guidelines apply to prose content only. Code blocks, code snippets, JSON/YAML examples, API URLs, and technical identifiers should maintain their functional format as required by the programming language or specification.
:::

### Acronyms

Write the full phrase/name in the first reference with acronym in parentheses.

### Ampersands (&)

Generally, write out “and” rather than using an ampersand.

Exceptions:

- Two things that go together as a pair (e.g., peanut butter & jelly, black & white)
- When it is part of a company’s name or composition title
- In a table where space is very limited
- When character count limits dictate it

### Colon

Lowercase the first word after a colon unless it is a proper noun or the start of a complete sentence.

Examples:

- Here are the company’s brand colors: purple and magenta.
- I discovered the company’s primary color: It is purple.

### Commas

Use serial/Oxford comma.

### Dashes

Use en dash (with spaces on each side) within sentences to create a pause. Use hyphens between dates, times, ranges, as well as hyphenated words.

### Days, Dates, Time

Always use Arabic figures, without st, rd, nd, or th.

When a month is used with a specific date, abbreviate Jan., Feb., Aug., Sept., Oct., Nov., and Dec.

When a phrase lists only a month and year, spell out the month and do not separate the month and the year with commas.

When a phrase refers to a month, day and year, set off the year with commas.

Use figures except for noon and midnight.

Use am or pm.

### Ellipses

Include three periods with a space before and after the ellipsis. If the words that precede an ellipsis constitute a grammatically complete sentence, place a period at the end of the last word before the ellipsis. Follow it with a regular space and an ellipsis.

### Numbered Lists

Use numerals with periods, not parentheses.

### Numbers

In general, spell out numbers one through nine, and use figures for numbers 10 and higher. There are many exceptions that always take figures (addresses, currency, etc.).

### Percent

Use % symbol instead. (This is an exception to AP style.)

### Periods

Use one space after periods.

### Periods After Bullet Points

Do not use periods with short bullets or list of items with only a few words. For anything long or in “sentence structure,” strive for no period. But if a bullet is so long that two sentences are necessary, then put a period on ALL bullets within that bullet cluster, even if they are not all complete sentences.

### Periods After Headlines (Certain Cases)

Use a period at the end of headlines that have a comma in the middle.

### Semicolon

Use sparingly. More often, use a period and start a new sentence instead. Do not capitalize the word after a semicolon unless it’s a proper noun.

### Telephone Numbers

Drop periods and dashes. For international numbers, include + and country code.

Examples:

- 952 933 1223 – domestic
- +1 800 621 6972 – international

Exception: Code examples and JSON data may use unformatted phone numbers as required by the API specification.

### URLs

Do not use the http:// or www in a URL when writing in prose.

Example: entrust.com

Exception: Code blocks, API endpoints, curl commands, and functional examples must include the full URL with protocol (https://) as required for the code to function correctly.
