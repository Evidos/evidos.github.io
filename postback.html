<h2>Request Information</h2>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p>None.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>By default we will send a postback when:</p>
<ul>
	<li>There is a status change in the transaction (eg the transaction went from waiting for signer to all signed)</li>
	<li>There is a signer activity (eg an email was sent)</li>
	<li>There is a receiver activity (eg an email was sent)</li>
</ul>

<p>
	A postback is sent at-least-once.
	There is no de-duplication.

	If the postback url returns a non 2xx http status code we will queue any new postbacks.
	In the meantime we will retry to deliver the first failed postback with an increasing interval (the first retry is within a few minutes).
	After 5 successive failed attempts we will send you an email.
	We will include the attachment with the received response (if any).

	When we receive a 2xx http status code we will mark the postback url as available and start sending the queued postbacks.
</p>

<h3>Checksum</h3>
<p>
	To verify that the postback responses are from SignHost you MUST verify our digital signature checksum. This signature is a hash of some parameters from the response and the sharedsecret. In order the generate the Checksum you will need a sharedsecret.
</p>
<p>The checksum is generated using the following formula:</p>
<pre>Checksum = SHA1(transaction id + | + file id + | + status  + | + sharedsecret)</pre>
<p>
	As you may have noticed the “pipe” sign (|) is used as the delimiter between values. You may need to put the delimiters between single quotes (‘) or double quotes (“) depending on the programming language that you will be using.
	The value returned by the SHA1 function is a string of 40 characters representing a hexadecimal value.
	How to use the SHA1 algorithm depends on your development platform. Most languages and frameworks (such as PHP and ASP.NET) have built-in implementations of the SHA1 algorithm. For other languages, such as classic ASP, implementations of the SHA1 algorithm are available online.
